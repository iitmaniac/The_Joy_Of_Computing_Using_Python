# The_Joy_Of_Computing_Using_Python
**This repository includes basic Python codes taught by Prof. S.R.S. Iyengar at "IIT Ropar" (last updated till October 2019)**

**First_Program.py** : It's a basic first program, where how we write the Python codes.

**Taking_Input_From_User.py** : It describes how to take input from users while performing some operations in Python.

**Discount_Calculation.py** :It takes the Inputs from users such as item prices, item quantity and available discount and generates invoice in output which contains total Discount calculations.

**Multiplication_Tables.py** : It takes the input from user such as desired table which user wants to watch and the total number of 'multiples' the user wants to calculate for.

**Token_Counter_Using_While_loop.py** : It displays the Token Number in a institution and takes input from the counter person for the further continuation of the Token Counter.

**List_Operations.py** : This includes basic List Operations performed on various lists in the program.

**Fizz_Buzz_Puzzle.py** : Here we are writing the function for famous Fizz-Buzz puzzle for the given set of numbers and displaying the output for the given input values by the end users. We are using multiple if-elif-else statements for the Puzzle execution.

**Aggregated_Measures.py** : In this program we are finding the mean, trimmed mean and median of a given list of data and comparing all the three by plotting all of them into the graph on the console using matplotlib library. The objective of using trim_mean is to see that this trimmed mean value is more near to the median value compared to normal mean for the data list having outlier values. The mean, trimmed mean, median and mode are called as 'Aggregated Measures'.

**Magic_Square.py** : It will calculate the Magic Square for a valid given number greater than 2 and displays it on the Terminal with its magic number(i.e. Sum of it's diagonal / row / column which will be the only same number) .
